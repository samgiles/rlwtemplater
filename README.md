# Really Lightweight Templating

Yes! Yet another small templating library for Javascript. The age old problem
that has been solved coutless times. Why another?  So I could practice getting
used to node and javascript again, and additionally, try out mocha for the first
time.

On top of this, I wanted a really lightweight templating library that I didn't
have to learn for a larger side project and weighing in at 10 short lines of
code makes this ideal.
